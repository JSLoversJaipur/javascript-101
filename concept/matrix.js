// Matrices and Basic Operations: A Guide for Medical Students

// Matrices are mathematical structures that are used to represent and manipulate data in a grid-like format. In the medical field, matrices can be used to organize and analyze various types of data, such as patient records, clinical measurements, or medical imaging data.

// A matrix is defined as a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Each element in the matrix is identified by its position, which is specified by the row and column indices.

// Matrix Representation:
// A matrix can be represented in JavaScript as a 2D array, where each inner array represents a row of the matrix.

// Example of a 3x3 Matrix:
const matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
  ]

  
  // Basic Matrix Operations:
  
  // 1. Addition of Matrices:
  // Matrices can be added together if they have the same dimensions. The corresponding elements of the matrices are added together to produce a new matrix.
  
  // Example:
  // Matrix A
  const matrixA = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
  ];
  
  // Matrix B
  const matrixB = [
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8],
  ];
  
  // Addition of Matrices A and B
  const resultAddition = [
    [0, 0],
    [0, 0],
  ];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < matrixA.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < matrixA[i].length; j++) {
      resultAddition[i][j] = matrixA[i][j] + matrixB[i][j];
    }
  }
  
  console.log("Result of Addition:", resultAddition);
  
  // 2. Multiplication of Matrices:
  // Matrices can be multiplied together under certain conditions. The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix has dimensions equal to the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix.
  
  // Example:
  // Matrix C
  const matrixC = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4],
  ];
  
  // Matrix D
  const matrixD = [
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8],
  ];
  
  // Multiplication of Matrices C and D
  const resultMultiplication = [
    [0, 0],
    [0, 0],
  ];
  
  resultMultiplication[0][0] = matrixC[0][0] * matrixD[0][0] + matrixC[0][1] * matrixD[1][0];
  resultMultiplication[0][1] = matrixC[0][0] * matrixD[0][1] + matrixC[0][1] * matrixD[1][1];
  resultMultiplication[1][0] = matrixC[1][0] * matrixD[0][0] + matrixC[1][1] * matrixD[1][0];
  resultMultiplication[1][1] = matrixC[1][0] * matrixD[0][1] + matrixC[1][1] * matrixD[1][1];
  
  console.log("Result of Multiplication:", resultMultiplication);
  
  // These basic matrix operations can be extended to larger matrices by following the same principles. The addition and multiplication of matrices are fundamental operations used in various applications, including medical data analysis, image processing, and statistical modeling.
  
  // Understanding matrices and their operations is valuable for medical students, as they can apply these concepts to analyze and interpret complex medical data sets, perform statistical calculations, and work with medical imaging data.
