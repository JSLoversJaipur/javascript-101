<!-- Basic Operations of Browser JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide -->

<!-- JavaScript is a programming language that can be executed in a web browser, providing interactive and dynamic functionality to web pages. Let's explore some of the basic operations that you can perform with JavaScript in a browser environment. -->

<!-- 1. Accessing HTML Elements: -->
<!-- JavaScript allows you to access and manipulate HTML elements in your web page. You can select elements using their IDs, classes, or other attributes, and then perform various operations on them. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Accessing HTML Elements</title>
  <style>
    .my-element {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="heading">Hello, World!</h1>
  <p class="my-element">This is a paragraph.</p>

  <script>
    // Access and modify the content of an HTML element
    const heading = document.getElementById('heading');
    heading.innerHTML = 'Welcome!';

    // Add or remove CSS classes to change element styles
    const paragraph = document.querySelector('.my-element');
    paragraph.classList.add('highlight');
  </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, JavaScript code is used to select the HTML elements with the ID "heading" and the class "my-element". The code modifies the content of the <h1> element to display "Welcome!" instead of "Hello, World!". It also adds a CSS class called "highlight" to the <p> element, which changes its style according to the CSS rules. -->

<!-- 2. Handling Events: -->
<!-- JavaScript allows you to handle various events that occur in the browser, such as user clicks, form submissions, and keyboard interactions. You can attach event listeners to HTML elements to perform specific actions when an event occurs. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Handling Events</title>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="my-button">Click Me!</button>

  <script>
    // Attach an event listener to a button
    const button = document.getElementById('my-button');
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
      alert('Button clicked!');
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, JavaScript code is used to select the button element with the ID "my-button". An event listener is attached to the button, which listens for the "click" event. When the button is clicked, an alert box with the message "Button clicked!" is displayed. -->

<!-- 3. Modifying Styles: -->
<!-- JavaScript allows you to modify the styles of HTML elements dynamically. You can change CSS properties, apply animations, or toggle classes to manipulate the appearance and behavior of elements. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Modifying Styles</title>
  <style>
    .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="heading">Hello, World!</h1>

  <script>
    // Change the style of an element
    const heading = document.getElementById('heading');
    heading.style.color = 'red';

    // Toggle a CSS class
    heading.addEventListener('click', function() {
      heading.classList.toggle('highlight');
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- In this example, JavaScript code is used to select the heading element and modify its style. The code changes the color of the heading to red. Additionally, an event listener is attached to the heading, so that when it is clicked, the "highlight" class is toggled, resulting in a yellow background color applied to the heading. -->

<!-- These are just a few basic operations of JavaScript in a browser environment. JavaScript provides many more capabilities, including manipulating the DOM, making AJAX requests, handling form submissions, and performing calculations. By understanding and utilizing these operations, you can create interactive and dynamic web pages. -->
